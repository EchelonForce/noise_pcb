Assembly Order
 - Surface Mount Resistors
 - Ceramic caps first, the solder points are below sockets on the top side.
 - IC Sockets
 - Diodes and Ferrite Beads
 - Polarized Caps
 - 2x5 Socket
 - 7805 Regulator
 - Jacks, aligned to panel.

V1 (with 1k buffer resistors) Current Draw:
 +12V Rail, 21mA
 -12V Rail, 7mA



V2 changes to make:
 - Use better footprint for polarized caps.
 - Fix missing cap values - done.
 - Fix Gain of inverted filtered white noise, it's -1 it should be -2 to get actual inversion of other output.
 - Change all the resistors on buffers to 10k or 100k to reduce current. - done
 - Add alternate 7805 footprint for T0-92 or surface mount.


Front Panel Notes. 
Inverted filt on v2 is 0:-10V not 0:10V -fixed in latest
